📌 Retail Order & Sales Analysis – Using MySQL & Python
End-to-End Data Analytics Project

Project Overview
This project was executed using both MySQL and Python, where SQL was used for structured business querying and Python was used for statistical validation and deeper analysis.
This project illustrates the full journey of working with large datasets — from acquisition and preparation to analysis and interpretation.
🔹 High-Level Breakdown:
1. Data Extraction: Datasets were accessed programmatically through the Kaggle API, ensuring reproducibility and efficiency.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Leveraged Python with Pandas to handle incomplete records, standardize formats, normalize data, and remove inconsistencies.
3. Database Integration: Transformed and loaded the refined dataset into SQL Server to enable structured querying and scalable analytics.
4. Data Analysis: Applied advanced SQL queries to explore the data, conduct aggregations, and derive insights that drive decision-making.

⛓‍💥 Workflow Components:
Kaggle API: Automated dataset download for streamlined access.
Python & Pandas: Executed cleaning operations, including:
Addressing missing or inconsistent values
Transforming column formats for uniformity
Detecting and eliminating duplicate entries
SQL : Stored and queried the cleaned dataset to conduct detailed analysis.
SQL-Based Analysis: Designed queries to
→ Aggregating total sales, profit, and quantity
